Chemical controls were to be applied just after regular tracking showed that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.</p>
<p>Preventing specimens from being attacked and damaged by pests is a major challenge of collection management. Some require long-term agreements that cost $400 or more even though for many pests, a single treatment done well should suffice. Once the committee comprehends the types of pests that might enter the structure and potentially damage collection materials, the next action is to set up an IPPM program to address the determined requirements.</p>
