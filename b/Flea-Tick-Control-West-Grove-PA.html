<p>IPM benefits from all proper pest management choices including, the cautious use of pesticides. Monitored control is based upon a sound knowledge of the ecology and analysis of the projected trends in pest and natural-enemy populations. Executing these preventive pest management essentials can help guarantee your deliveries make it from point A to point B without any pests onboard.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM technique by Swezey et al.

If your facility currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to approach least-impact services and products.</p>
