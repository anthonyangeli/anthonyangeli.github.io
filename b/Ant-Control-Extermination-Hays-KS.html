<p>Prior to signing a contract for pest control, you must be clear about the cost being paid, the services being covered and the presence of cancellation charges, Anti-Pesto says. You can use traps to capture specific pests, and barriers to protect plants from insect attack or disease infection. Along the continuum, extra non-chemical strategies such as cultural controls, biological controls, resistant crop ranges, mating disruption, sterile insect release, etc., may be integrated into the system.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 species of termites, spiders, and insects have actually established some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the form of a solid, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests prefer crops like maize, sunflower, okra (woman finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a bigger community and handles both with the big image in mind.</p>
<p>Pests that follow a particular seasonal pattern can be managed by changing planting dates. The addition of insulation into the attic and walls of a structure can offer control of common pests in addition to known insulation benefits such a robust thermal envelope and acoustic sound cancelling residential or commercial properties.
