Besides regular external spraying, whenever there was thought to be a risk of a pest problem developing, there was no recorded or regular pest control program at MTSL at the time of the initial audit.</p>
<p>The behavior of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).

<p>Using information about pests' biology and routines, in addition to an arsenal of pest management methods, pest control workers locate, recognize, and get rid of pests. However because these "sex" traps attract primarily male insects, they aren't really effective controls. This consists of mechanical, physical, cultural, biological and chemical control of pest.
