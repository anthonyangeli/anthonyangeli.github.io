Thankfully, we do not have to suffer in silence when our houses are attacked by rodents or bugs as there is a myriad of pest control approaches to pick from. Particular hairs of fungi, germs, and infections can naturally contaminate a variety of pests.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest reliable dosage when other techniques of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
