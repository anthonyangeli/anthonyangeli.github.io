You can use traps to capture particular pests, and barriers to safeguard plants from insect attack or illness infection.

And vice versa, pest management specialists can use video to record and narrate assessments and leave a copy for the center supervisor by means of e-mail, or carry out a real-time video co-inspection with the consumer if they are not able to be present at their facility throughout the examination.</p>
<p>Biological pest control procedures make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs preliminary job is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural opponents assists to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions.

Adjustments of insect reproductive systems strategies such as decontaminated pest method (SIT) and incompatible bug strategy (IIT) offer environmental-friendly and innovative methods for IPM.
