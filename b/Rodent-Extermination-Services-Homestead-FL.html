In essence, the linking of IRM and IPM offers a management viewpoint that is the very same as long-term, areawide pest management (Elliott et al., 2008). A pest control company does not simply go directly to getting rid of pests.</p>
<p>Physical controls include mulches for weed management, steam sanitation of the soil for disease management, or barriers such as screens to keep birds or insects out. Biological control is typically utilized for greenhouse pests, but not to the exact same degree in the field.
