This method refers to the use of a range of mechanical or physical techniques for pest exemption, trapping (in many cases comparable to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

But by concentrating on non-chemical alternatives initially, you can ensure that your pest management program is effectively eliminating pests at the least danger to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
<p>The decision of the right reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect species or life phases.</p>
<p>Biological control includes using a pest's natural opponents (e.g., predators, parasites, pathogens and parasitoids), to control pest abundance. The term "IPM," under different authors have actually advocated for the concept of including, the full array of pest management practices with production goals in an overall systemic method. These control approaches can be cost-efficient and very efficient and present little to no risk to people or the environment.</p>
