Paperwork would be hard to acquire even if concerted efforts were made due to the multiple prospective causes for brief and long-lasting illnesses and signs related to direct exposure to pests and pesticides.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove due to the fact that growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan.
