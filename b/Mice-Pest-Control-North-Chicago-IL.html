<p>A tailored post-construction and pre-construction service to avoid the attack or control from termites. The historical and more prevalent usage of this term is limited to use of natural enemies to handle populations of pest organisms. Some scientists likewise recognized that if regionally coordinated IPM might occur, even annual management of a continuous pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998).</p>
<p>Throughout our mission for alternative pest control measures, the IPM idea has actually by far received the most attention as an extensive pest management approach.
