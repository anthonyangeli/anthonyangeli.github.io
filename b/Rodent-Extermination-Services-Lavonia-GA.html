IPM programmes preliminary job is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and characteristics of pests and natural enemies helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control specialists even repair structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and scheduled management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use picked biopesticides with low environmental effect. Expert exterminators utilize different types of pesticides and baits to eliminate and eliminate pests. Efficient, permanent corrective actions can then be taken to prevent pests from going into the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
