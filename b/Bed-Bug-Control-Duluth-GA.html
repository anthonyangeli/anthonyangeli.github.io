<p>Fleas and ticks are two of the most frequent pet care concerns in America. Efficient, less dangerous pest controls are chosen first, consisting of highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Evaluation is frequently one of the most crucial actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of examining an IPM program and the outcomes it has actually created.</p>

Public demand is influenced by retail marketing strategies, issues for food security based upon pesticide regulations in their area, and a lack of understanding on food production to name a few factors.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses a lot of the same ideas as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>Kaolin particle films used in natural farming might control some pests, however can negatively affect natural opponents and cause other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may encourage natural enemy populations, however a greater variety of natural opponents does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ).
