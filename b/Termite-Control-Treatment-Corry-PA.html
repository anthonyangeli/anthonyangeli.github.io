To resolve invasive pest concerns, classical biological control method is typically utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).

<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very efficient in causing substantial reductions in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).
