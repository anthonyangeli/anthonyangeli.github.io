<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off because growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan.

<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest problems, classical biological control method is typically used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been efficiently used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
