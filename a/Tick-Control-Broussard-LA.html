IPM holds that wiping out a whole pest population is often difficult, and the effort can be expensive and environmentally risky. Baits provide control over an extended amount of time, less item is required and can be utilized in sensitive environments (e.g. kitchens, schools, etc).</p>
<p>Destruction of crop residue: Pupae of bug remains inside the crop residue and can be managed by destroying it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all farming crops, however synthetic pesticides remain a dominant tactic in handling pests. Possibly you're the type to dive in, research your pest, explore the most efficient control choices, and are feeling well prepared to take things on by yourself.</p>
<p>This new model is expected to direct IPM methods all over the world to develop and implement sustainable agricultural practices to make sure profitability for the growers, cost to consumers, and food security to the growing world population. For instance, host plant resistance is successfully used in some crops with pest and disease tolerant or resistant varieties, but not in other crops.</p>

In fact, some artificial pesticides (e.g., artificial pyrethroids vs pyrethrins and neonicotinoids vs nicotine) are manufactured mimicing the pesticidal particles of natural origin.
