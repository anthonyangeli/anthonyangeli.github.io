<p>Pest control is a very crucial step owing to the reality that a variety of pests are carriers of hazardous disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the eradication of a few pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are nothing brand-new to pest control-- pest control experts regularly utilize scents traps as a means to keep an eye on pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a brand-new idea. </p>
<p>Correctly identify pests and beneficials on sticky cards and plants. The knowledge of different control alternatives, pest biology and damage potential, and viability of available resources allows the grower to make a decision appropriate for their situation. Greenhouses provide a suitable environment (e.g., temperature level and light) for many biological control agents or natural enemies consisting of parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
