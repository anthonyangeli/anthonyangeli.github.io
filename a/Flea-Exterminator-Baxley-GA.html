<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and identify them accurately, so that suitable control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. Nevertheless, the significant pattern has been toward making use of contemporary chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less harmful chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; but these means are still therapeutics.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the community as an entire and considers a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>The decision of the correct reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest.
