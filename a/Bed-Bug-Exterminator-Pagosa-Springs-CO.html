Using natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are artificial and urged pesticides need to only be used as a last option or only used as required and frequently only at specific times in a pests life cycle.</p>
<p>Cover or remove bird cages and fish tanks, and relocate other pets before using aerosol (spray) pesticides. Ensure the person who will be applying your pesticides holds a valid photo ID Pest Control Licence. Consumers need to notify the pest exterminators about the specific infestations before the treatment or at the time of booking. Planting potatoes well away from the previous year's crop avoids access to required food and the beetles will starve.</p>
