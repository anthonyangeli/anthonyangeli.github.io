<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, manage, and decrease threat from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a manner that minimizes overall financial, health, and environmental dangers.</p>
<p>Pest control is a very important procedure owing to the truth that a number of pests are carriers of harmful disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the removal of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
