<p>Chemical insecticides were to be used in the way least disruptive to biological control. After dealing with numerous national chain exterminators and being mostly disappointed with the service, I relied on Terminators for assist with pest problems at my place of business.

Your cropping program must focus primarily on preventive practices above and below ground (# 1 and # 2) to develop your farm's natural defenses.
