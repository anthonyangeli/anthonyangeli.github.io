Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to explain a methodical method of handling pests utilizing non-chemical pest management techniques and the cautious usage of pesticides when pest populations surpass acceptable levels.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or routine pests like roaches, ants, or spiders, we will determine the source of the problem.
