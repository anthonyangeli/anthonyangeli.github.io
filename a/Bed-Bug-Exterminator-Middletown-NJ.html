<p>We historically have actually sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound approaches as well as its array of fundamental strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, pressures of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the probability that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
