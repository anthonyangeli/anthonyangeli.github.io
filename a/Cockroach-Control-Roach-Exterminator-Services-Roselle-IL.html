<p>Thank you for choosing RID Pest Control to secure your house from termites.

Perhaps biological control is most known for importation of natural enemies, typically from the pest's area of origin, to control non-native pests (e.g., importing vedalia bettles to control cottony cushion scales which were assaulting California citrus orchards).</p>
<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a mix of pest management methods, a practice referred to as integrated pest management. The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to arthropods, diseases, and weeds, though contested by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the intensification of pest control.</p>
