<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of environmentally unsound methods in addition to its selection of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, pressures of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the probability that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance. </p>

The primary approach is to promote beneficial insects that parasitize or eat target pests.</p>
