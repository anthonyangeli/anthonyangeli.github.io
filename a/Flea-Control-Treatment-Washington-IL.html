The following example explains the six parts of an Integrated Pest Management program used to handle carpenter ants. Focusing generally on long-lasting pest prevention, an effective IPM program utilizes a combination of control methods including biological control, habitat control, changes to cultural practices and use of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are classified into different groups based upon their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and rotating chemicals from different mode of action groups is suggested to lower the threat of resistance advancement (Sparks and Nauen 2015 ). Government policies limit the time and quantity of certain chemical pesticides and help alleviate the associated risks. </p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down development and feeding and go through greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). Simply put, an efficient, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm outbreak may be to retard its development and damage while giving the parasitoids time to work, thus enhancing the parasitoids' result during subsequent generations.</p>
