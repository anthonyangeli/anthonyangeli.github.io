<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically specifically about decreasing pesticide usage. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are not able to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Instead, call HiCare and have our professionals check your homes for white ants and termites. And vice versa, pest management professionals can utilize video to record and narrate assessments and leave a copy for the facility manager via email, or carry out a real-time video co-inspection with the consumer if they are unable to be present at their center during the evaluation.</p>
