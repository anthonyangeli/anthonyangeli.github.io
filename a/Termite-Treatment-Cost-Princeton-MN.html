<p>These unknown or badly understood potential hazards argue for additional levels of defense including direct exposures to multiple pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet; exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds and personal care items; and the general trouble in associating persistent illnesses to any one specific cause.</p>

<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as a whole and takes into account a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly achieve levels at which damage is triggered therefore ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For instance, a rich area likely will have a lot of big, expensive homes, so pest control costs could be greater there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses. </p>
