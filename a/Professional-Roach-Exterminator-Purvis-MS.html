<p>Worldwide, more than 500 species of mites, insects, and spiders have actually developed some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the form of a strong, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests prefer crops like maize, sunflower, okra (lady finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton.
