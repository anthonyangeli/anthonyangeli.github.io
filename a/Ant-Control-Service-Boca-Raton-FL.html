Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 500 types of mites, spiders, and insects have actually developed some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the kind of a solid, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests choose crops like maize, sunflower, okra (lady finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a bigger environment and manages both with the huge photo in mind.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was hence synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used just after regular monitoring showed that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the cost of the control measures.</p>
