Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and diseases, though contested by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>

Select a pesticide that is pest particular, if readily available; keep in mind, do not eliminate the helpful insects.

IPM stresses the use of non-chemical control methods, such as exemption or trapping, before chemical choices.</p>
